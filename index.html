     <div class="article-body">
      <p id="article-body-1">Organizers of the September 21 anti-corruption protests in the Philippines have announced that they are gearing up for another coordinated, massive action on November 30, reflecting the rising anger over the systematic theft of people’s money and the clamor to overhaul the country’s political system dominated by a few powerful clans.</p>
      <p id="article-body-2">Asked about the planned protest, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. called for peaceful rallies and warned participants against causing any trouble. He didn’t mention that protests continue to gather momentum because of rising frustration over the slow pace of holding accountable corrupt contractors and legislators, and their accomplices in the bureaucracy.</p>
      <p id="article-body-3">Marcos has established an independent commission to investigate infrastructure corruption, but the newly created body has been criticized for its initial refusal to livestream its sessions. It has also yet to state that it is willing to look into the role of the president and his office in the approval of pork barrel funds and ghost projects. Some critics have accused the president of trying to deflect blame by directing the commission to focus on corruption-tainted projects involving officials not directly linked to his office.</p>
      <p id="article-body-4">Despite feigning surprise about the extent of the corruption that has flourished on his watch, Marcos cannot easily absolve himself of responsibility. After all, it was his office that drafted the national budget; he signed the budget bill into law, which means he approved congressional insertions, and the agency head implicated in the flood control scandal is part of his Cabinet.</p>
      <p id="article-body-5">Marcos also cannot claim ignorance about how the pork barrel system facilitates corruption, since he served for many terms as governor, congressman, and senator before becoming president in 2022. Last October, his allies in the House of Representatives approved the proposed 2026 budget containing allocation for unprogrammed appropriations, which the opposition decried as a form of presidential pork barreling that can be used for patronage and to consolidate control of the bureaucracy ahead of the 2028 election.</p>
